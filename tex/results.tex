\section{Results}

The technique described in this paper was implemented in ABC \cite{abc-link}. It applies algebraic rewriting to the AIG and generates the polynomial signature. The experiments were conducted on a PC with Intel(R) Xeon CPU E5-2420 v2 2.20 GHz x12 with 32 GB memory. The experiments include gate-level rewriting of Carry-Save-Adder (CSA) multipliers and {\color{red}radix-4 Booth multipliers}, up to 512 bits. The results are compared with \textit{functional extraction} \cite{ciesielski2015verification} and {\color{red}the Grobner Basis based approach \cite{sayedformal:date-2016}\cite{pruss2015TCAD:efficient}, using post-synthesized circuits.} 
The results show that the proposed technique is more efficient than the state-of-the-art technique for extracting the polynomial expressions for those arithmetic circuits. 

We evaluate our AIG-based algebraic rewriting approach using pre-synthesized and post-synthesized CSA multipliers shown in Table \ref{tbl:pre-post-tbl}, and post-synthesized complex arithmetic circuits shown in Table \ref{tbl:complex-circuits}. The gate-level arithmetic circuits are unsigned and are taken from \cite{ciesielski2015verification}. Booth multipliers are generated by \textit{\%blast -b} command using ABC \cite{abc-link}. The runtime and memory usage are compared to \textit{functional extraction} \cite{ciesielski2015verification}. In Table \ref{tbl:complex-circuits}, the functions of the arithmetic circuits are shown in the first column.
The bit-width varies between 64 and 512 bits\footnote{512-bit post-synthesized multipliers are not reported in \cite{ciesielski2015verification}.}. We can see that the runtime of the proposed approach outperforms other approaches for the post-synthesized multipliers for any bit-width. The memory usage has been reduced on average 60\%, compared to \textit{function extraction} \cite{ciesielski2015verification}. Also, the complexity of extracting the polynomial expression using functional extraction is increased when the multipliers are synthesized. For example, extracting post-synthesized 256-bit multiplier using functional extraction requires 9x more runtime and more memory. However, using the proposed approach, the runtime of extracting pre- or post-synthesized multipliers are almost the same. More importantly, we can see that our approach surpass \textit{functional extraction} on complex arithmetic designs (Table \ref{tbl:complex-circuits}).
