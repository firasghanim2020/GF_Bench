# GF_Bench

This repository is a collection of GF multipliers, including BLIF, EQN, and Mapped Verilog format.
Galois Field Multipliers benchmarks generated by Prof. Kalla's group [1], including Mastrovito [3] and Montgomery [2] multipliers. These benchmarks have been used for evaluating our parallel verification approach [4] and reverse engineering [5] approach.


/blif: Pre-synthesized blif files of Mas and Mont multipliers.

/verilog: Post-synthesized (technology mapped) verilog files generated by ABC[6].

/eqn:  Pre-synthesized eqn files.
